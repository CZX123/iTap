# iTap

Take attendance with a TAP!

## TODOs

### Immediate Priority
- ~~Change take attendance behavior when online to show dialog instead of retrying~~
- ~~Check wifi as well when marking attendance with wifi~~
- ~~Add loading icon in login button after login to show feedback~~
- ~~Add loading icon in place of qr code if qr code fails to load~~

### Other features
- Build change password into the app
- ~~Remove 'About iTap' webview and hardcode it directly into the app~~
- Remove 'Attendance History' webview and include it directly into the app, through fetch request for json data, and the use of Data Tables
- If possible, smoothly transition between the different stages (absent, present with check in, present with check out) through smoother animations (icon animations, translations).

### Long-term
- Transfer all data from Weiqi's database to Firebase
- If possible, use Google Forms API to directly input attendance data
